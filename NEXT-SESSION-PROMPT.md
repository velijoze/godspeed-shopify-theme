## Quick Start for Next Session

1. **Verify deployment still works**:
   ```bash
   git status
   # Make small test change
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: deployment check"
   git push origin main
   # Check GitHub Actions for success
   ```

2. **Continue development**:
   - All deployment issues are resolved
   - Focus on theme features and content
   - Deployment is fully automated

3. **If deployment fails**:
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Verify SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN secret exists
   - Ensure token hasn't expired

**Status**: ✅ Ready for continued development
**Deployment**: ✅ Fully automated and working
**Next Step**: Continue with theme customization and features
