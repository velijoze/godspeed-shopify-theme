# 🗺️ Next Steps Roadmap - Pipeline Implementation

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Required - Priority Tasks**

### **🌐 Task 8: Internationalization (Critical)**
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH - Swiss market requirement

**Objectives**:
- [ ] Set English as source language for all templates
- [ ] Implement German/French/Italian fallbacks
- [ ] Move remaining hardcoded text to locale files
- [ ] Validate translation keys exist for all user-facing text

**Files to Process**:
```
locales/de.json       # German translations
locales/fr.json       # French translations  
locales/it.json       # Italian translations
locales/en.default.json # English source

Templates with hardcoded text:
- templates/page.financing-calculator.json
- templates/page.range-calculator.json
- templates/page.service-booking.json
- sections/bike-compare.liquid
- sections/size-calculator.liquid
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Audit all template files for hardcoded text strings
2. Create translation keys following naming convention: `pages.{page}.{element}`
3. Replace hardcoded text with `{{ 'key' | t }}` syntax
4. Validate all locale files have corresponding keys
5. Test language switching functionality

### **🧪 Task 9: Expanded Test Coverage (High)**
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours  
**Priority**: 🟡 HIGH - Quality assurance

**Objectives**:
- [ ] Create comprehensive Playwright tests for all Pipeline features
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing for cross-linking sections
- [ ] Test all tool functionality and user workflows
- [ ] Performance testing for new page templates

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
```
tests/pipeline-comprehensive.spec.ts:
├── Feature Testing
│   ├── Compare tool functionality
│   ├── Size calculator accuracy  
│   ├── Financing calculator operations
│   ├── Range calculator validations
│   ├── Test ride booking flow
│   └── Service booking workflow
├── Cross-linking Validation
│   ├── Homepage tool showcase
│   ├── Related tools sections on all pages
│   ├── Context-appropriate suggestions
│   └── Link functionality verification
├── Visual Regression
│   ├── Services-grid section layouts
│   ├── Tool interface consistency
│   ├── Mobile responsive design
│   └── Cross-browser compatibility
└── Performance Testing
    ├── Page load times with new sections
    ├── JavaScript execution performance
    ├── Mobile 3G network simulation
    └── Core Web Vitals validation
```

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Extend existing `tests/pipeline-features.spec.ts`
2. Create visual baselines for all enhanced pages
3. Implement user journey testing (compare → size → financing → test ride)
4. Add mobile-specific test scenarios
5. Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## 🔧 **Secondary Priority Tasks**

### **⚙️ Task 12: Dawn Utility Optimization (Medium)**
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Performance optimization

**Objectives**:
- [ ] Gate Dawn utility JavaScript behind theme settings
- [ ] Conditionally load cart CSS based on usage
- [ ] Reduce bundle size for Pipeline-focused experience
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

### **🧹 Task 11: Asset Cleanup (Low)**
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Priority**: 🟢 LOW - Repository maintenance

**Objectives**:
- [ ] Scan all files for icon references
- [ ] Generate list of unused icon assets
- [ ] Present deletion recommendations
- [ ] Clean up unused assets after approval

### **🧽 Task 13: Artifact Cleanup (Low)**
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Priority**: 🟢 LOW - Repository hygiene

**Objectives**:
- [ ] Remove local playwright-results artifacts
- [ ] Keep test configuration files
- [ ] Update .gitignore if needed

## 📋 **Continuation Prompt**

When ready to continue this implementation, use this prompt to resume work:

```
Continue Pipeline implementation for Godspeed E-Bike Shopify theme:

CURRENT STATUS: 70% complete - Phase 1 (Tasks 1-7 + Cross-linking) finished
IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Task 8 (Internationalization) - Critical priority

CONTEXT:
