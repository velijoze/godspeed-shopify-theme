## 🚀 New Prompt for You

```
I need to fix my Godspeed e-bike Shopify store based on Playwright test results. 

My tests ran successfully and identified these critical issues:

1. **Site Loading Issue**: Page shows "Nur einen Moment…" (German loading message) instead of proper title - this is breaking all customer journey tests

2. **Missing UI Elements**: 
   - Language selector button not found
   - Mobile menu button not found
   - Login form fields not found

3. **Accessibility Issues**: Focus management and keyboard navigation failing

4. **API Issues**: Collections and products APIs returning 404

Current test results: 62 passed, 37 failed, 19 skipped (52.5% success rate)

Please help me fix these issues to improve my test pass rate. Start with the highest priority site loading issue that's showing "Nur einen Moment…" instead of the proper page title.
